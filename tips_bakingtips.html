			<p>Baking soda and baking powder are both very common chemical leaveners used in baking; below you will learn about the key differences between them, when you should use each, and how to make substitutions. Let’s flex those baking muscles!</p>

			<p>Today we’re tackling the subject of baking soda vs. baking powder. Nearly every baking recipe includes one of these (or both!) and if you’re like me, you may have wondered why some recipes call for one or the other and if it’s possible to make substitutions.</p>
		<p>Baking soda and baking powder are both odorless white powders that work as leaveners, however, they are chemically different.</p>
		<p>Let's get started!</p>
		</div>
		<h2>What is baking soda?</h2>
		<div class="wrap_contents" id="content_soda">
			<img class="img_content"  src="image/baking_soda.jpg" alt="Baking Soda" >
			<div class="content_img">
				<p>Baking soda is also known as <strong>sodium bicarbonate</strong> or <strong>bicarbonate of soda</strong>.</p>
				<p>The first thing to understand is that baking soda is a base. So, it needs an acid to react with to create carbon dioxide (bubbles!), which is what gives rise to baked goods such as cakes, cookies, and biscuits.</p>
				<p>The most common types of acids called for in recipes with baking soda:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>Lemon juice</li>
				<li>Yogurt</li>
				<li>Buttermilk</li>
				<li>Sour cream</li>
				<li>Brown sugar</li>
				<li>Cream of tartar</li>
				<li>Vinegar</li>
				<li>Molasses</li>
				<li>Applesauce</li>
				<li>Honey</li>
				<li>Natural cocoa powder (<strong>NOT</strong> Dutch-process)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Baking soda will create leavening on its own when it is heated, but it also produces sodium carbonate, which can result in a metallic taste. This effect is neutralized in baked goods by adding those acids!</p>
			</div>
			<br>
			<h3>How much to use?</h3>
			<p>A general rule of thumb is ¼ teaspoon of baking soda per 1 cup of flour.</p>
			<h3>Baking soda uses</h3>
			<p>These are a few examples are recipes that use just baking soda as its leavener, and I've included that the acid that's used to activate that base!:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Snickerdoodles (acid: cream of tartar)</li>
			<li>Texas Sheet Cake (acid: sour cream & natural cocoa)</li>
			<li>Irish Soda Bread (acid: cream of tartar & buttermilk)</li>
			<li>Soft and Chewy Gingersnap Cookies(acid: molasses)</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Make-ahead note</h3>
			<p>Baking soda begins to work as soon as it touches liquid, so it is important to bake items that are only leavened with baking soda as soon as the batter or dough is mixed together. The longer you let it sit, you'll notice a decrease in the leavening effect.</p>
		</div>
		<h2>What is baking powder?</h2>
		<div class="wrap_contents" id="content_powder">
			<div class="content_img2">
				<p>Baking powder is a mixture of baking soda, cream of tartar (an acid), and, at times, cornstarch.</p>
				<p>Most baking powder sold today is “double-acting” – this means that it first releases a small amount of carbon dioxide (leavening) when combined with wet ingredients, and then releases the majority of the leavening when the baking powder is heated (in the oven). A great one-two punch!</p>
				<p>Since baking powder already contains an acid (cream of tartar), it is typically paired with non-acidic ingredients, such as whole milk and Dutch-process cocoa powder.</p>

			<h3>How much to use?</h3>
			<p>A general rule of thumb is 1 teaspoon of baking powder per 1 cup of flour.</p>
			<h3>Baking powder uses</h3>
			<p>These are a few examples are recipes that use just baking powder as its leavener:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Blueberry Muffins</li>
			<li>Easy Buttermilk Biscuits</li>
			<li>Chocolate Chip Scones</li>
			<li>Cut-Out Sugar Cookies</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Make-ahead note</h3>
			<p>Since baking powder does not require acid and most of its leavening occurs in the oven, it is safer to make batters and doughs using only baking powder ahead of time without sacrificing leavening.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box">
			<h2>What is the difference between baking soda and baking powder?</h2>
			<p>To recap everything we talked through above, the primary difference between the two boils down to this:</p>
			<p>Baking powder already contains an acid, while baking soda NEEDS an additional acid ingredient to create the rising action.</p>
			<p>When in doubt, use baking soda in recipes that include an acidic ingredient; and use baking powder in recipes that do not include an acidic ingredient.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box">
			<h2>Recipes that use both baking soda and baking powder</h2>
			<p>So, then why would some recipes call for both baking powder and baking soda?</p>
			<p>The most common reason is that these recipes contain an acid, but the combination with baking soda is not enough to fully leaven the recipe, so baking powder is used to add the necessary lift. These recipes maximize the amount of acid neutralization and leavening power.</p>
			<p>There are two other reasons for using both:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>If a recipe is relying on an acidic ingredient for flavor (like buttermilk or lemon juice), too much baking soda would neutralize that flavor. Using both baking soda and baking powder maximizes the flavor <em>and</em> the rise.</li>
			<li>Baking soda helps baked goods to brown better; if baking powder is the main leavener, sometimes baking soda is added to help with browning.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="box">
			<h2>Baking soda vs. baking powder</h2>
			<p>I hope that I've armed you with tons of knowledge regarding the differences between baking soda and baking powder so that when you are baking and encounter a recipe that you may want to tweak, you'll better understand what makes these leaveners work and how different types of ingredients might impact your final result.</p>
			<p>Happy Baking, friends!</p>
